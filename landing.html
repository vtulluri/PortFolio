												<h3>Times Series Analysis on Stock Market </h3>
												<p>&#x2022; In this data analytics project, I conducted an analysis and visualization of the closing price trend, total volume of traded stock, and daily percentage return for four major tech companies: Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. </p>
												<p>&#x2022; Using Python's seaborn library, I visualized the inter-relationship between the closing prices and daily percentage returns of these companies, employing multivariable analysis techniques. This allowed me to identify any potential correlations or dependencies between these variables. Additionally, I conducted a Value at Risk (VaR) analysis for each company to assess the potential losses that could occur within a specific confidence level. </p>
												<p>&#x2022; By exploring these aspects, this project provides valuable insights into the stock market performance of these tech giants, aiding in investment decision-making and risk management strategies.</p>

												<h3>Text Analysis on Youtube videos with Python</h3>
												<p>&#x2022; In this data analytics project, I conducted text analysis on YouTube videos using Python to gain valuable insights into the content and engagement of the platform. The project involved several key components. </p>
												<p>&#x2022; Firstly, sentiment analysis was performed on the comments of specific YouTube videos, uncovering the audience's attitudes towards the content and the YouTubers themselves. This analysis provided valuable information about the overall sentiment and feedback received by the videos. </p>
												<p>&#x2022; Additionally, I computed audience engagement rates and like rates across different categories of videos, helping identify which types of content resonated most with viewers. This analysis shed light on the factors driving engagement and popularity on YouTube. </p>
												<p>&#x2022; Furthermore, I investigated the relationship between the number of views and the number of likes, as well as the relationship between video title naming and the number of views, using linear regression models. These analyses allowed for a deeper understanding of the factors influencing video popularity and the effectiveness of video titles in attracting viewers. </p>
												<p>&#x2022; Overall, this data analytics project provided valuable insights into YouTube video content, audience engagement, and factors contributing to video popularity.</p>
