												<h3>Data Dynamo: Unleashing Insights - A Covid19 Exploration with Azure Data Factory  </h3>
												<p>&#x2022; I used Azure Data Factory to simplify and automate the handling of Covid-19 data, making the analysis process more comprehensive. This involved applying various data engineering techniques and tapping into Azure's cloud infrastructure. The main goal was to make the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of Covid-19 datasets smoother, ensuring that the data is both clean and up-to-date for analysis. Through this project, I showcased my skill in creating efficient data pipelines that can scale, allowing information to flow seamlessly. Beyond just demonstrating my proficiency with cloud-based tools, this project reflects my dedication to using advanced technologies to gain valuable insights into the global health situation.</p>

												<h3>E-Commerce Churn Prediction  </h3>
												<p>&#x2022; In the E-Commerce Churn Prediction project conducted in May 2023, I navigated a dataset comprising 24 attributes, encompassing crucial details such as customer ID, churn flag, tenure, preferred device, and city tier. Employing data cleaning techniques, I meticulously prepared the dataset for analysis. Utilizing the OneHotEncoder for feature encoding, I implemented a Decision Tree algorithm that yielded an impressive accuracy rate of 95%. This project not only demonstrated my proficiency in handling and processing diverse datasets but also showcased my ability to leverage machine learning algorithms effectively for predictive analysis. By focusing on churn prediction, the project aimed to provide valuable insights for e-commerce businesses in understanding and mitigating customer attrition, thereby contributing to the enhancement of customer retention strategies in the dynamic e-commerce landscape.</p>

												<h3>Times Series Analysis on Stock Market </h3>
												<p>&#x2022; In this data analytics project, I conducted a thorough examination and visualization of closing price trends, total traded stock volume, and daily percentage returns for key tech industry players, namely Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. Employing Python's seaborn library, I meticulously visualized inter-relationships between closing prices and daily percentage returns, utilizing advanced multivariable analysis techniques to discern potential correlations and dependencies. Additionally, I executed a Value at Risk (VaR) analysis for each company, assessing potential losses within specified confidence levels. This project yields invaluable insights into the stock market performance of these tech giants, providing essential support for investment decision-making and the formulation of robust risk management strategies.</p>

												<h3>Text Analysis on Youtube videos with Python</h3>
												<p>&#x2022; In this data analytics project, I conducted text analysis on YouTube videos using Python to glean insights into content and engagement on the platform. The project encompassed sentiment analysis on video comments, revealing audience attitudes towards content and creators. This analysis yielded valuable information on overall sentiment and feedback. Additionally, I calculated audience engagement and like rates across video categories, identifying content types resonating most with viewers. Investigation into the relationships between views, likes, and video titles, employing linear regression models, deepened understanding of factors influencing video popularity. In summary, this project provided key insights into YouTube video content, audience engagement, and the elements contributing to video popularity.</p>
